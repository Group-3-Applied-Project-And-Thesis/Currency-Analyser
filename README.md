# 4th Year Applied Project: Currency Analyser

> Module: Applied Project and Minor Dissertation / 4th Year Software Development  
> Team: Johnny Glynn, Rebecca Kane, Tara O'Kelly (Group 3)
> Supervisor: Dr Ian McLoughlin

## General Plan
We aim to create a currency analyser, including both traditional currencies and some of the major digital currencies, like [Bitcoin](https://www.bitcoin.com/) and [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/). We aim to incorporate machine learning to analyse past fluctuations in various currency prices, and *attempt* to decipher a trend in prices - obviously we can't predict the future.

## Technologies
[Python](https://www.python.org/), [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), [D3.js](https://d3js.org/), [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/).
