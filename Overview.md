# Dissertation Overview
Basic ideas, structure, topics to consider etc.  

##Introduction
Lay out basic idea of project.  
Applied aspect: webapp, what it does, basic technologies, machine learning/tensorflow.  
Theoretical aspect: correlation between prices, influences, any maths/theorems/hypotheses etc, theory to do with prediction.  

**Aims / Goals / Objectives**  
Create a webapp that displays up to date (<1min~) graphs of currency prices, traditional and crypto. Incorporate machine learning to recognise patterns/trends. NLP for analysing content across the web to "predict" changes in prices (twitter specifically, mentioned by @JohnnyGlynn) - world events (tweeted about, using keywords) have an effect on traditional currencies.  

Discuss ideas in detail in thesis, more conceptual, some maths etc, theory behind ML/pattern recognition.
